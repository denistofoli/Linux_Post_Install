# Linux_Post_Install
Shell Script to automate the installation and configuration of programs

After repeating this process for two weekends testing Pop Os, Manjaro, Xubuntu.

I decided to create this script that makes my desktop ready for use.

# Use
Change the script execution permission with "chmod 755 scriptAlex.sh"

Then run the script with "./scriptAlex.sh"
